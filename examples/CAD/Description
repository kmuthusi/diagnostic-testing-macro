This example demonstrates the use of %diag_test SAS macro to evaluate performance of multiple classification machine learning algorithms based on published work on coronary artery disease (CAD) detection. In summary, CAD is a common type of cardiovascular disease (CVD) which fatal if not treated. The authors trained the models on 75% of the data (227 observations) and evaluated performance of five binary classification machine learning algorithms in detection of CAD using the renaming 25% (76 observations). The algorithms were: Logistic Regression (LR), Classification Tree with Bagging (Bagging CART), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Since we did not have the predicted probabilities, we recreated them by rerunning the models based on author specifications. We then used the SAS macro to compare their performance in predicting detecting CAD. While the authors of the original study evaluated models based on only Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy and AUC measures, we present all the diagnostic measures.
